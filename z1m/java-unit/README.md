# 🏢 Z1:M (Enterprise Core Module)

**Z1:M** is the enterprise-grade backend platform of the **G1:M ecosystem**, responsible for transforming human activities into structured, auditable, and manageable business operations.

While **G1:M** integrates **Human × AI × Robot interactions**, **Z1:M** manages the administrative and financial backbone that supports those interactions.

## 🌐 Position in the G1:M Ecosystem

```
Human Reality World
(MediaPipe / Mobile / Sensors)
            ↓
Avatar Universe
(Unity / Three.js / Plower)
            ↓
Robotics Matrix
(Unitree / Physical AI)
            ↓
      Z1:M
Enterprise Core System
```

G1:M enables humans, AI, and robots to collaborate.

Z1:M ensures that these collaborations become:

* Structured
* Persistent
* Traceable
* Auditable

---

# 🎯 Mission

Traditional RPA focuses on automating user operations.

Z1:M aims to go further.

Instead of reproducing mouse clicks and keyboard input, Z1:M treats business processes themselves as structured data.

This enables:

* Reduced manual operations
* Consistent execution across systems
* Financial accountability
* Complete audit trails

---

# 🧩 Role within G1:M

Z1:M provides enterprise services used by various G1:M modules.

Examples include:

## 📅 Workforce Operations

* Shift scheduling
* Attendance management
* Task assignment

For example:

A shift schedule created inside G1:M can be transformed into:

* Google Calendar events
* Outlook Calendar entries
* Internal scheduling systems

Z1:M processes the generated business data and synchronizes it across platforms.

---

## 💳 Billing and Financial Processing

Z1:M serves as the external financial component for applications inside the ecosystem.

Responsible for:

* Payment processing integration
* Donation tracking
* Transaction recording
* Revenue management
* Financial reconciliation

---

## 🧠 Knowledge and AI Applications

Modules such as:

### Plower

Local-first RAG application.

Used for:

* Document retrieval
* Internal knowledge management
* Interaction history storage

### CyberNet Call

WebRTC communication system.

Used for:

* Communication event tracking
* Session state management

These applications generate operational data that can be processed by Z1:M.

---

## 🔐 Identity and Compliance

* Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
* Immutable audit logs
* Traceable system activities
* Separation of personal and financial information

---

# 🏗 Architecture

Z1:M is designed using:

* Java
* Spring Boot
* JPA / Hibernate
* Docker
* H2 Database (development)

Example architecture:

```
Controller Layer
        ↓
Business Logic
        ↓
Repository Layer
        ↓
Separated Databases
 ┌────────────┐
 │ Personal DB│
 └────────────┘

 ┌────────────┐
 │Financial DB│
 └────────────┘
```

The separation between personal information and financial information is intentional to improve maintainability and security.

# ☕ Why Java?

Many modern backend projects choose Go or Rust.

Z1:M intentionally adopts Java.

Reasons include:

## ✔ Proven Enterprise History

Java has decades of production use in:

* Banking
* Government systems
* ERP platforms
* Large-scale enterprise applications

---

## ✔ Large Talent Pool

Java remains one of the most widely used enterprise languages worldwide.

This improves:

* Maintainability
* Recruitment
* Knowledge sharing

---

## ✔ Strong Static Typing

Business systems require correctness.

Java provides:

* Compile-time verification
* Robust IDE support
* Reduced runtime errors

---

## ✔ Designed for Large Systems

Z1:M is intended to evolve from:

```
Personal Projects
        ↓
Small Teams
        ↓
Business Applications
        ↓
Enterprise Platforms
```

Java's mature ecosystem supports this evolution.

---

## ✔ Vendor Neutrality

Z1:M avoids dependence on specific vendors.

Built upon:

* Open standards
* Open-source frameworks
* Containerized deployment

This minimizes platform lock-in.

---

## ✔ Stability Over Novelty

The goal of Z1:M is not to adopt the newest technology.

The goal is to build systems that organizations can trust for years.

Correctness, maintainability, and operational stability are prioritized over trend adoption.

---

# 💡 Design Principles

## Minimal Personal Data

Only necessary information should be stored.

---

## Separation of Concerns

Execution logic and business logic should remain independent.

---

## Cloud Agnostic

Deployable anywhere using containers.

---

## Incremental Growth

Designed to scale from:

* Proof of Concept
* Internal tools
* Department systems
* Enterprise platforms

---

# 🚀 Future Directions

* Multi-tenant SaaS architecture
* Event-driven processing (Kafka)
* Financial-grade transaction systems
* Integration with payment providers
* Advanced audit capabilities
* Cross-module billing infrastructure for G1:M applications

---

# 🌏 Vision

G1:M aims to become:

> **"The Android OS for Human–AI–Robot interaction."**

Z1:M aims to become:

> **"The enterprise operating layer that transforms those interactions into accountable business processes."**

Humans create intent.

AI interprets and optimizes.

Robots execute.

**Z1:M records, validates, and manages the resulting operations.**
